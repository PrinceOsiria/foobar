## Solar-Doomsday (Challange 0)
Notes:

I completed this challange when I was still in High School. I was designing Hel's Keyhole, which
is an encryption program which eventually evolved into Project 107 and 108. This challange
wasn't particularly difficult, and I remember enjoying it.

## Re-ID (Challange 1)
Notes:

This challange was easy, so I somewhat over-engineered it. I adapted a previous piece of code
that I had written (The prime miner) and used it to assign IDs as requested. The entire code was
formatted into a module, with additional options for debugging and testing inputs included

## Lovely Lucky Lambs (Challange 2)
Notes:

Day 1: Completed the initial code logic. Returns are all valid looking.

Upon closer inspection, using the generous method, 13 lambs were being distributed with remainders.
I noticed that I could distribute these lambs in a way that would not cause revolts, so I implemented this.
Upon doing so, test case 10 failed.

This confuses me, as the returns were the same, while the methods were slightly altered. 
Nonetheless, I continued, removing this and cleaning up my code, before uploading it to github.

Day 2: Test Case 7 is still failing. Every output seems to be valid, and I am unsure what the
error entails due to lack of feedback (the test case is hidden)

I have done some research, and reached out to a few friends. Nothing seems to help. Other people's
solutions are much messier, but follow the same algorithm. I am unable to ascertain where the error
lies, but I will continue to ponder and poke
