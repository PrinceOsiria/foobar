# foobar
 
Notes:

Day 1: Completed the initial code logic. Returns are all valid looking.

Upon closer inspection, using the generous method, 13 lambs were being distributed with remainders.
I noticed that I could distribute these lambs in a way that would not cause revolts, so I implemented this.
Upon doing so, test case 10 failed.

This confuses me, as the returns were the same, while the methods were slightly altered. 
Nonetheless, I continued, cleaning up my code, and uploading it to github.

Day 2: Test Case 7 is still failing. Every output seems to be valid, and I am unsure what the
error entails due to lack of feedback (the test case is hidden)
