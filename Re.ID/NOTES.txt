Hello, World!

Maybe I went a little overboard with this one, but I think from a scalable  standpoint, if Commander Lambda wanted to, 
she could compile a csv of indices, parse it, generate IDs, assign them names from the csv, attach names and ids to a dictionary, and export the dictionary as a csv
This approach would be ideal if she used google forms to generate the csv, sending the form to all of her minions

ID Generation is based on a previous script of mine, namely "Prime Miner". The original script returns a list of all primes within 0:arg, while the modified version returns arg primes

Thanks for reading!
